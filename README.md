# IBM Cloud Functions Workshops

*Welcome to the homepage for workshops that are designed to teach you how to develop **serverless applications**, composed of loosely coupled microservice-like functions, using the [IBM Cloud Functions](https://cloud.ibm.com/functions) service. IBM Cloud Functions is based upon the [Apache OpenWhisk](https://openwhisk.apache.org/) open-source serverless platform whose initial codebase came out of IBM Research and was donated to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF).*

Specifically, this repository contains various workshops for developers wishing to learn, in a step-by-step manner, how to use the IBM Cloud Functions Serverless platform using both client tooling such as the IBM Cloud Command Line Interface (CLI) as well as the IBM Cloud Web User Interface (UI).

The workshops are organized incrementally, by developer experience level from beginner to expert, as well as providing independent exercises showing how to provide specific Function integrations with IBM Cloud services such as Cloudant (NoSQL), Cloud Object Storage (COS), Mobile Push Notifications and others.

The workshops are organized as follows:

* [**Prerequisites**](prereqs/README.md) - Provides instructions on how to sign up for IBM Cloud and the IBM Cloud Functions service, as well as the installation of the Command Line Interface (CLI) and other tooling needed for the workshops.
* [**NodeJS Introductory Workshop**](101-workshop-nodejs/README.md) -
